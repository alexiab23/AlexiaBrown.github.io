									<h1> Alexia Brown<br />
									</h1>
									<p>Hello! I am a self motivated Data Analyst who is self taught in SQL, HTML, and now Python! <br>
										I have experience collecting, cleaning organizing, analyzing and interpreting Data in Excel, Tableau and Power BI.
									I always strive to answer questions and problems with quantatative driven insights to help create a successful business operation.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/headshot.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

								<p>My curiosity began while studying in university working with data. The most significant wins in my career 
									always revolved around data and doing captivating detective work. Every project was different from the last one, which 
									required a great level of comprehension to manipulate and use data. There are many techniques I have learned, 
									which I leveraged into achieving results from the full process of analyzing data such as:<br>
									
									<br>
									1. Data Cleaning <br>
									2. Data Extraction <br>
									3.Data Management <br>
									4. Data Analysis <br>
									5. Building Dashboards and Reports <br>
									6. And many more! <br>
									
									<br> The process of discovering a problem and gaining 
									insights, leads to innovation and is always rewarding. It is remarkable how data can be used to build models which 
									are then processed into making unique predictions 
									in the near or far future â€“ you can have data without information but not information without data.</p>

									<p> I think of myself as a very laid back person. I do love to write in my free time as well as watching anime, reading comics, making music and playing video games with friends! 
										I find great joy in 
										immersing myself in these to past the time â€“ especially when I'm feeling stressed from a query or issue I run into when coding. 
										Since we are on the topic of gaming, I discovered coding by playing Roblox way before I was even intoduced to the Data World! 
										Life can sure be interesting!) </p>

										 	<div><img src="images/playstation-small.jpg" alt=""/> </div>-->
												<br>

												<p>My passion has always been tied to curiosity and living a better lifestyle and travelling to as much places as I can before my departure from this earth. 
													I am truly blessed to have met people who share the same goals and have the same desires as I do. I believe the earth is absolutely breath taking and has so many unknowns worth exploring!</p>
												
													

						
										<p>
											Communication ðŸ“§ <br>
											Feel free to reach out or message me at any time! I am always happy to connect with other individuals! I am also 
											always open to new opportunities as well. No two minds are alike and together everyone achieves more! As Bob Feller 
											once said, "Every day is a new opportunity. You can build on yesterday's success or put its failures behind and start
											 over again. That's the way life is, with a new game every day...".
